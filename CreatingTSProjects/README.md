# Creating TS projects

In this sections I made some tutorials about how to get started some projects using Typescript. Unfortunetly you won't see every kind of framework, just some of my day use technology, but feel free to make a PR adding more or just improving what I have done until now.

## Get start with:

-   ## [React](./React.md) <sub><sup>[CreateReactApp, Vite and NextJS]<sup/></sub>

-   ## [React Native](./ExpoReactNative.md) <sub><sup>[Expo]</sup></sub>

-   ## [Node](./Node.md)

-   ## [Svelte](./Svelte.md)
